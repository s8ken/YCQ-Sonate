# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the Symbi Trust Protocol seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@s8ken**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Affected Component**: Which part of the system is affected
- **Affected Version**: Version number or commit hash
- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept
- **Impact**: Description of the potential impact
- **Suggested Mitigation**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing
4. **Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is available

## Threat Model & Security Controls

### STRIDE Threat Analysis

| Threat Category | Attack Vector | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------------|---------------|--------|-----------||
| **Spoofing** | Impersonation of trusted entities | Identity fraud, false declarations | Cryptographic signatures, PKI validation, DID/VC integration |
| **Tampering** | Modification of trust declarations or scores | Data integrity compromise | Content hashing, Merkle trees, append-only audit logs |
| **Repudiation** | Denial of actions or declarations | Loss of accountability | Digital signatures, immutable audit trails, timestamping |
| **Information Disclosure** | Unauthorized access to sensitive data | Privacy breach, competitive advantage loss | Encryption at rest/transit, RBAC, data minimization |
| **Denial of Service** | System availability attacks | Service disruption | Rate limiting, DDoS protection, circuit breakers |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Unauthorized access escalation | System compromise | JWT RBAC claims, principle of least privilege, input validation |

### Abuse Cases & Attack Scenarios

#### 1. Sybil Attacks & Astroturfing
- **Attack**: Creating multiple fake identities to manipulate trust scores
- **Controls**: 
  - Identity verification requirements
  - Proof-of-control mechanisms (domain, email, wallet)
  - Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection
  - Rate limiting on declaration creation

#### 2. Collusive Declarations
- **Attack**: Coordinated false positive declarations between entities
- **Controls**:
  - Cross-validation of declarations
  - Reputation weighting of issuers
  - Temporal analysis of declaration patterns
  - Whistleblower mechanisms

#### 3. Replay & Rollback Attacks
- **Attack**: Reusing or reverting previous declarations/scores
- **Controls**:
  - Nonce-based replay protection
  - Monotonic timestamps
  - Append-only audit log design
  - Merkle chain integrity verification

#### 4. Model Poisoning
- **Attack**: Manipulating scoring algorithms through adversarial inputs
- **Controls**:
  - Sandboxed scoring execution (VM/WASM)
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Algorithm versioning and rollback capability
  - Anomaly detection in score changes

#### 5. Supply Chain Attacks
- **Attack**: Compromising dependencies or build pipeline
- **Controls**:
  - Dependency scanning (OWASP Dependency-Check)
  - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
  - Signed commits and releases
  - Container image scanning

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT with RBAC Claims**: Subject/issuer scopes, role-based permissions
- **API Key Authentication**: Service-to-service authentication
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: For administrative access
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling, timeout policies

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for sensitive data storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Schema Validation**: Zod/AJV validation on all API boundaries
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries, ORM usage
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy, input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies

#### Network Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict allow-list for cross-origin requests
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint and per-user rate limits
- **DDoS Protection**: CloudFlare or similar protection

#### Monitoring & Incident Response
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Incident Response Plan**: Defined procedures for security incidents
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security assessments

### API Security Controls

#### Rate Limiting
\`\`\`yaml
Endpoint Limits:
  POST /declarations: 10 requests/minute per user
  GET /scores: 100 requests/minute per user
  POST /audits: 5 requests/minute per user
  Authentication: 5 attempts/minute per IP
\`\`\`

#### Replay Protection
- **Nonces**: Cryptographic nonces for write operations
- **Idempotency Keys**: Prevent duplicate processing
- **Timestamp Windows**: Reject requests outside time window

#### Input Validation
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic signature validation
- **Schema Compliance**: Strict JSON schema validation
- **Content Length Limits**: Prevent oversized payloads
- **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 validation and sanitization

### Cryptographic Standards

#### Signature Algorithms
- **Primary**: ECDSA with P-256 curve (ES256)
- **Alternative**: RSA-PSS with SHA-256 (PS256)
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 for content integrity

#### Key Management
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation every 90 days
- **Key Escrow**: Secure backup of critical keys
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with high iteration count

### Compliance & Governance

#### Data Privacy
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to erasure, data portability
- **Data Retention**: Automated deletion of expired data
- **Consent Management**: Explicit consent for data processing

#### Audit Requirements
- **Immutable Logs**: Tamper-evident audit trail
- **Log Retention**: 7-year retention for compliance
- **Access Logging**: All data access logged and monitored
